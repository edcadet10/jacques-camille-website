# Security Guidelines for Jacques Camille Website

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in this website and provides guidance for maintaining secure development practices.

## Security Features

1. **Security Headers**
   - Implemented via Next.js config and middleware
   - Includes CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers
   - Protects against XSS, clickjacking, and other common web vulnerabilities

2. **Data Access Layer**
   - Centralized data access in `utils/data` directory
   - Prevents direct access to APIs from components
   - Ensures consistent validation and sanitization

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - All user inputs are sanitized before processing
   - Rate limiting implemented for API endpoints
   - Maximum input lengths enforced

4. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Uses secure cookies for sessions
   - Implements proper CSRF protection
   - Middleware for route protection

5. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Sensitive variables stored in platform-specific environments
   - No API keys committed to the repository
   - `.env.local` in `.gitignore`

## Deployment Security

1. **Build Process**
   - Type checking with strict TypeScript configuration
   - Linting to catch potential issues
   - Dependencies regularly audited

2. **Platform Configuration**
   - Uses Netlify's secure deployment features
   - HTTP headers configured in `netlify.toml`
   - Environment variables managed through Netlify's secure environment

## Security Best Practices for Development

1. **Never Store Sensitive Information in Code**
   - API keys, passwords, and other credentials should never be hardcoded
   - Use environment variables and secrets management

2. **Regular Security Updates**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Subscribe to security bulletins for Next.js and other major dependencies

3. **Code Review Guidelines**
   - Check for input validation and sanitization
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Verify authorization checks
   - Look for potential data leaks

4. **Testing**
   - Implement tests that check security controls
   - Consider fuzzing inputs to test validation
   - Test with different user roles

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to jack@wethrivbold.com. Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been handled by the security team.

## Security Checklist Before Deployment

- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Ensure no API keys or secrets are committed to the repository
- [ ] Verify all user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Check that security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Test the application with security tools
- [ ] Confirm that error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Ensure proper HTTPS redirect is in place
